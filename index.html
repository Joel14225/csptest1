  <title>Sample Website #1</title>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Website</h1>
    <p> hello
      <p> Here is another paragraph of text.
        <hr> 
    <p> And here is another paragraph.
      Notice that spacing doesnt really matter 
      Everything is printed on one line on the page.
      Even tho in code these are all seperate lines 
      <p> If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag.
        <p>See
